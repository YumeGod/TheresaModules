# Theresa Modules Source Sode
### Some modules source code from Theresa - 1.8.9 Premium Hack Client
## Reason I make this public:
### Since Mirror & SuperSkidder (our head developers) quit Minecraft, currently there are nobody updating this client, so I decide to open source Theresa Hack Client to help people learn Minecraft coding.
## Reason I only make a part of Theresa public:
### I used to want to open source the whole Theresa Hack Client project, but since there are many skidder kids who don't even know how to code a client but start selling their client with just changed a client name from some open sourced client such as LiquidBounce, so I decide to only open source some modules from Theresa Hack Client for people who is really trying to learn Minecraft coding but not copy paste.
